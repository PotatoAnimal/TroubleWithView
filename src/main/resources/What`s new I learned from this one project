How this works?
You ask at MyController to do any of methods. Aspect around dao methods starts work. From MyController method u goes
to serviceImpl, than to daoImpl. At DAOImpl ur methods have logic how they works.
And after all of this u goes back to MyController return statement to go back to view. And there u have information
after all logical process.
MyController->ServiceImpl->DAOImpl->MyController.return.view->view.jsp
